## Introduction

Welcome to the **Fake News Detection** project! This repository contains a Colab notebook that uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect fake news. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models and libraries, this project aims to identify and classify news articles as real or fake.

## Features

- Classifies news articles as real or fake.
- Uses pre-trained models for high accuracy.
- Supports integration with other applications via an API.
- Interactive and easy-to-use Colab notebook.

## Tech Stack

### Frameworks and Libraries

- **Google Colab**: An interactive notebook environment that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser, making it ideal for developing and testing machine learning models.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project, known for its simplicity and extensive support for machine learning and NLP libraries.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for handling arrays and performing numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It is used for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing. It helps in text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and more.
- **SpaCy**: An open-source library for advanced NLP. It is designed specifically for production use and helps with text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, named entity recognition, etc.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: A library that provides general-purpose architectures for natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) with pre-trained models like BERT, GPT-2, and more.
- **TensorFlow**: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning, used here for building and training neural network models.
- **Keras**: An API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and provides clear & actionable error messages.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
    cd fake-news-detection
    ```

2. Open the `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

3. Ensure you have all the required packages installed:
    ```python
    !pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk spacy transformers tensorflow keras
    ```

## Usage

To use the fake news detection model, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

2. Run the cells in the notebook to load the necessary libraries and pre-trained models.

3. Preprocess the dataset by tokenizing, stemming, and vectorizing the text data.

4. Train the machine learning model using the provided dataset.

5. Input the news article you want to classify.

6. Execute the classification function to get the prediction.

Example:
```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline('text-classification', model='your_pretrained_model')
news_article = "Your news article text goes here..."
prediction = classifier(news_article)
print(prediction)
```
